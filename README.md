Isabelle verification of univariate real root isolation algorithms based on Descartes' rule of sign. Includes the classical bisection algorithm and a more efficient one based on Newton iteration by Sagraloff (https://doi.org/10.1145/2442829.244287). Work depends primarily the "Three_Circles" (https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Three_Circles.html) AFP entry.
